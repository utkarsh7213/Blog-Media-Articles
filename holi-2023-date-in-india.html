    Hiranyakashyap got banned by only taking the name of God in his kingdom and started being himself as the God. But Prahlad, the son of Hiranyakashipu, were a devotee of God. And the same Hiranyakashyapâ€™s sister Holika had got the boon of not being consumed in the fire. Once Hiranyakashyap ordered Holika to sit in the fire with Prahlad in her lap. Holi was celebrated because Sister Holika got burned because of sitting in the lap but prahlad got saved, thats why we started Holika Dahan in the memory on God's Devotee Prahlad.
